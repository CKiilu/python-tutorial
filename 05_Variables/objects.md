#VARIABLES, OBJECTS AND VALUES

Everything in python3 is an object.

Every object has an ID, a type and a value. IDs and types(classes) cannot change. Values of mutable objects can change whereas those of immutable objects cannot be changed.

To check this, type in the python3 console using this as an example:

	x = 1

	type(x)

	id(x)

All variables in python are first, class objects.
